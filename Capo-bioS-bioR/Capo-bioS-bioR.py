# The following code was used in [Physics of language models: Part 3.1, 3.2, 3.3] to perform 
#   knowledge augmentation (permutation) on a given biography. While it is easy to do so for [bioS] data, for
#   Llama1/2-generated biographies, we wrote this code to handle various real-life cases. 
# Note this code may not always succeed, sometimes Llama1/2-generated biographies may not even contain the person's
#   full name and there are numerous edge cases; but we manually checked and such edge cases are sufficiently rare.
